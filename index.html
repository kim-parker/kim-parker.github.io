       <p>After moving from England quite some time ago with my husband and two children, I worked as a Primary school teacher for fifteen years. Although, teaching is my passion I felt I was ready to delve into a new challenge and a new career as a Web Developer. Since moving to New Zealand I love to spend time outdoors with recreational activities. These include: tramping/hiking; fitness classes; and gardening.</p>
