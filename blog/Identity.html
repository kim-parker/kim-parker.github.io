<h1>Identity and Values

</h1>
<subtitle>Ethical Decision
</subtitle>

<p>During my teaching profession there have been times when I have had to make an ethical decision.
</p>

<p>The Teaching Council clearly sets out the profession standards, codes and values as a guide for teachers. There have been times when a situation has occurred which has involved a difficult choice as the options presented could not resolve the situation in a way that is accepted by ethical guidelines. When faced with this type of situation I have used my professional judgement and acting impartially, being truthful and honest when it relates to a studentâ€™s wellbeing and learning.
</p>
<p>My core value of integrity  and responsibility played a major part in my decision making process and although some situations can make you feel uncomfortable with the decision made I realise upon reflection my core beliefs and values contributed towards how I dealt with these situations.
</p>
<subtitle>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
</subtitle>
<p>I identify as an Indian who was born in Kenya and moved to England at the age of two. My culture and upbringing has been central to who I am, where I come from and the values that have been instilled in me. My family moved to England from Kenya following the end of colonisation. I grew up in a mainly traditional Indian home with three siblings and grandparents. As children our caregivers were mainly our grandparents as both parents  worked  long hours so they could establish a new life. My core values come from my grandparents who taught us to be grateful, to be respectful and to be honest. These values were taught using traditional folktales that always had a moral that they would share. These stories and values have been passed to my own children. </p>
<ul>My core values are:

<li>respect</li>
<li>integrity and trust</li>
<li>beomg grateful</li>
</ul>
<subtitle>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</subtitleh3>
</subtitle>
<p> This has been detailed in my Learning plan. My determination, positive attitude and growth attitude will assist in my learning journey.My limitations are set out in my learning plan. Taking risks is an obstacle I need to address especially when using new systems and software. 
</p>
<p>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
</p>
<p>As an ex-Team Leader there have been situations when I have dealt with difficult situations such as performance, appraisals and training.
       The situation involved a group of  staff that were being introduced and trained to new technology. It was very clear that one member of staff was feeling uncomfortable -body language - negative questions which followed with a complete breakdown after the meeting. 
    
</p>
<ol>Strategies included:</ol>
<li>empathy initially but being firm</li>
<li>Patience - listening to his/her concerns</li>
<li>Communication - reasons to support new technology</li>
<li>Build a training plan with additional training</li>
<li>Buddy up with an expert</li>
<subtitle>A Proud Moment</subtitle>
<p>As a child, Sports at school was something I never looked forward to and although I enjoy watching sports on TV I never dreamt I would participate in a sports team. When we emigrated to NZ  it was very clear that New Zealanders love their sports which also inspired me to keep fit. I participated in 10 km races around Auckland and completed the summer series of races for a few years. A group of runners invited me to join them and complete the half-marathon which motivated me to train and complete the challenge. I loved the camaraderie and positivity amongst the team. Finishing the half marathon will always be memorable and something I will treasure.
