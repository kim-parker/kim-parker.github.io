<h1>My Learning Plan

</h1>
<subtitle>What is your long term goal or career pathway?
</subtitle>

<p>To gain skills and knowledge to be a successful Web Developer. My long term goal would be to be able to seek employment as a Web Developer and continue to upskill and continue to learn so I can be up-to-date with any changes in technology.

</p>
<subtitle>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning?

</subtitle>

<ul>Key strengths:</ul>
<li>A team player</li>
<li>Ability to prioritize workloads</li>
<li>Prioritize workloads</li>
<li>Patience and determination</li>
<li>Excellent communicator</li>

<p>As an ex-teacher it is crucial  that teachers work collaboratively, share ideas, listen to the ideas of others, organise and plan for different curriculum areas. Many of the skills  listed above were gained whilst working in the Education Sector.

</p>
<subtitle>Limitations
</subtitle>

<p>My current limitation is working as an individual and communicating with members who are totally new to me, on an online forum. Learning remotely on an online system is new to me and it is something I am trying to adapt to and also  reach out to people I donâ€™t know.. Support systems are in place at Dev Academy but sometimes I feel I spend too long trying to solve errors independently before I reach for help. I guess I see it as a sign of weakness when eventually I contact the help request. Other areas for development would be planning and organizational skills.


</p>

<subtitle>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

</subtitle>

<p>During my time at Dev Academy I would like to strengthen my time management skills in regards to planning and the organisation of projects.
</p>

<subtitle>Managing Workloads
    
</subtitle>

<p>To allow full attention on this course I have left full-time employment for the duration of this course and subsequently this will allow me to complete the course. My workload is currently challenging me as I learn new skills, learn to problem solve and retain new learning. I need to be able to plan workloads more effectively so I am not burnt-out or working too late. 

</p>

<p>Last week I participated in a  home group meeting that was setup with my facilitator. This was very useful as I was introduced to other students at Dev Academy that I could reach out to when I am stuck with a problem.It also allowed me to discuss issues with the facilitator. Joseph was also able to address the key learning areas of the previous week which I found useful as this keeps me on track of the key objectives.

</p>

<p>I am taking breaks during the day, but I need to ensure that I return to my studies quickly without using delaying tactics or procrastinating over challenges.</p>

<p>The sprint challenges are taking much longer than the time box allows and this is an area of concern as my workloads have built up and I am not moving through the sprints as quickly. This has resulted in working weekends so I can try to keep pace.</p>


<p>Discord help requests have been very useful but I feel I am wasting too much time trying to solve issues independently as I usually contact the help request as a last resort. So far I have had little contact with the facilitation team but I feel they would be there to support me, guide and discuss any issues relating to the curriculum and concerns for completing the programme.
</p>

<p>This learning plan will be modified as I continue with the programme.

</p>

<ol>Key areas to work on:</ol>
<li>Frequent shorter breaks</li>
<li>Frequent shorter breaks</li>
<li> Stop procrastinating </li>
