        <h1>Do you know the difference between Margin, Border and Padding?</h1>
        <h2>If the answer is no, then read on.</h2>
        <p> The best way to explain the difference is by using the example as a guide.       
             </p>

             <p> The model above shows the structure of the components: margin; border;padding. The content is the element. When you change the value of the width and height, it is the content's width and height that will reflect the changes.</p>
                                                                                
             
             <subtitle> Margin</subtitle>
             <p> The margin is the space around an element. If you have used MS word, Google docs, you will know that margins are auto set to the default, however, you can edit the settings. Similarly, this can also be applied in the CSS style attribute. </p>
 
            <subtitle>
            Border  
            </subtitle>
            <p> The border box is the third overlapping box that surrounds the padding box. The purpose of the html border attribute is to set a visible border width for a table.The border value of most html elements is set to zero.
            </p>
           
            <subtitle> Padding
            </subtitle>
            <p>Padding is the space between the content and the border. The padding is the space between the actual content and the border of the element. It will have any background-color or background image property that has been applied to an element. (source:webpage).
            </p>

            <P> It is easy to get confused between margin versus padding properties in CSS as they both create the space around the element.</P>

            <img src="C:\Users\Kui_R\kim-parker.github.io\images\margin-auto2.png" width="900" height="500"/>

            <p> The example above indicates the following: </p>
            <ol>
                <li> The blue area is the content that is set to 50% width</li>
                <li> The area outside the blue area is the block border which extends the border area to include an empty area as it separates the element.
                <li> The margin is the transparent space outside the element.</li>
                <li> The margin is set to auto- this is the area outside the block area</li>
            </ol>

            <p> The further example'Hello World' clearly shows the space between h1 and p will be 30px.

            <UL>
                <li>
                    If you increase the size of an element's border it will INCREASE the distance between the padding box and the margin box.</li>
                <li> Margins can be set to auto but you cannot se the padding to auto</li>
                <li> The values of margin can be auto, length or %.</li>
                <li> The shorthand property is clockwise: margin top; margin right; margin bottom; margin left.</li>
